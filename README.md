# binorg_decoding
Bin-Organized Decoding (J. Neuro: Bae&amp;Luck, 2018). 

Here you will find an updated version of Bae & Luck (2018) analysis scripts.  We have updated the scripts to allow the use of bin-organized decoding, therefore allowing users to use EEGlab/ERPlab* to format and decode their own data more seamlessly. 

*ERPlab Version V8.1 REQUIRED

Order of Operations:
1. Decoding_binOrg.m
2. SVM_ECOC_ERP_Decoding_2020.m
3. SVM_ECOC_Stat_Plot_Permutation.m (on OSF)
4. SVM_ECOC_ERP_PermutationTesting.m (on OSF)

The original analysis scripts and data can be found on OSF:
